# TF2Frags.net Stream Controller

### Preface

Here is the code for the TF2Frags.net stream controller. Some of it is a mess. I wouldn't recommend trying to set it up/modify too much as it is very fragile with very little error handling (will be added eventually don't worry!)

The `index.html` file is served up by the `express` server and is used in a Browser Source in OBS (url localhost:3000).
